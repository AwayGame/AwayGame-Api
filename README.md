# AwayGame-Api
The official API of the [AwayGame App](https://www.awaygame.co/). 

## Installation
To run the API locally, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/AwayGame/AwayGame-Api.git
cd AwayGame-Api/functions && npm install
npm run serve
```
This will give you a URL that you can hit with requests

### Extras
This API requires a `config.js` file in the `functions` directory. You will need to contact an administrator for access to this file, as it is in the `.gitignore`
